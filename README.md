Tetris Game (C++ & SFML)
Project Overview
This repository contains a Tetris game implemented in C++ using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). It replicates the classic Tetris experience with smooth gameplay, intuitive controls, and a scoring system. The game gradually becomes faster as the player progresses through levels.

Features include:
1. Responsive controls: Move, rotate, and drop tetrominoes using the keyboard.
2. Score tracking: Earn points for clearing rows.
3. Game over detection: Ends when the grid is filled.
4. 2D Graphics: Smooth rendering using SFML.
5. Pause/Resume Functionality: Allow players to pause and resume the game.

Technologies Used:
C++ for core game logic and data handling.
SFML for graphics rendering, input handling, and window management.

Game Controls:
1. Left/Right Arrow Keys: Move the tetromino left or right.
2. Up Arrow Key: Rotate the tetromino.
3. Down Arrow Key: Speed up the fall of the tetromino.
4. Space: Drop the tetromino instantly.
